BackupPC
Mar 17, 2011  By Shawn Powers 
Some tools are so amazing, but unfortunately, if no one ever talks about them, 
many folks never hear of them. One of those programs is BackupPC. You may have 
heard Kyle Rankin and myself talk about BackupPC on the Linux Journal Insider 
podcast, or perhaps you've seen us write about it here in Linux Journal before. 
If you haven't checked it out, you owe it to yourself to do so. BackupPC has some 
great features:

* Hard drive-based backups, no tape swapping.
* Support for NFS, SSH, SMB and rsync.
* Hard linking to save valuable disk space.
* Individual files can be restored in place in real time.
* Powerful and simple Web interface.
* E-mail notification on errors.
* Free!

BackupPC is one of those projects that doesn't get updated terribly often. It 
doesn't have flashy graphics. It doesn't require constant maintenance. It just 
works, and it works well. Check it out: backuppc.sourceforge.net.

NoMachine NX
NoMachine NX is a fast terminal server and desktop virtualization system based on the 
X11 protocol.  NX is an order of magnitude faster than VNC or X11 and can run on bandwidth 
as narrow as 10 kBit/sec.  In addition, NX translates and embeds the MS Windows Terminal 
Server and VNC protocols into X/NX, enabling users to compress and accelerate remote Windows 
and VNC sessions.  The NX project provides a suite of libraries and X11 proxying agents 
implementing efficient compression and optimized transport of X11, SMB, IPP, HTTP, and 
arbitrary protocols like audio and video over the Internet.

tkpgp
tkpg is a program that provides a GUI front end to Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy 
(PGP) public-key encryption system and also the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG/gpg) implementation.
It utilizes the Clipboard Selection heavily to ease moving pgp-processed text both to and from 
any of your applications (such as mail reader, news reader, and editor).  This removes the 
need to select the output text by hand or by typing in a filename, since it is usually placed 
in the Selection automatically for you.

CodeMatch
=========
"CodeMatch compares thousands of source code files in multiple directories and 
subdirectories to determine which files are the most highly correlated. This can be used to 
significantly speed up the work of finding source code plagiarism, because it can direct the 
examiner to look closely at a small amount of code in a handful of files rather than thousands 
of combinations. CodeMatch is also useful for finding open source code within proprietary code, 
determining common authorship of two different programs, and discovering common, standard 
algorithms within different programs."
http://slashdot.org/story/11/03/02/174206/SCO-Found-No-Source-Code-In-2004#comments

"For the sake of full disclosure, I was hired by SCO for a month in 2004 as a consultant and 
potential testifying expert witness in this case. The code analysis had already been under 
way for a while by other consultants on the case. My CodeMatch tool for measuring source 
code correlation was fairly new at that time. I was really excited and saw this as an 
opportunity to prove my tools and "make my reputation in this field." The SCO attorneys gave 
me some code samples from SCO UNIX and Linux to compare. CodeMatch chugged along for days 
before generating a report showing very little correlation. The attorneys thanked me, paid 
me my very generous retainer (that they had put into my contract), and I never heard from 
them again."

Document Management For Research With Annotation?
"I'm currently looking for a document management system for personal and research-related 
use. Having looked at Alfresco and KnowledgeTree along with a slew of similar open source 
document management systems they seem to have a common set of features including version 
control, archiving, document permission/ownership and search/indexing. What I'd like, in 
order to help me manage my own continually growing collection of pdf/doc/odf/rtf/txt files, 
would be something that allowed me to view and annotate documents (and possibly 
collaborate/share notes) without requiring me to download, edit and re-upload each document. 
Obviously there are plenty of capable document management systems out there, so I really 
suspect I've simply missed something and am hoping someone can point me to a better way to 
index, search, collaborate and keep and share notes on the ever increasing glut of useful 
information I seem to use and collect."

Really cool idea.  Some good responses:

A coworker implemented a basic ruby service of this where I work and I have to say that he 
didn't find any open source alternatives before he started that fulfilled anywhere near what 
we needed. Ruby made it pretty easy (1 or 2 person job) with the emphasis just being 
javascript and DOM coding to get the interface correct. Then we just had a RESTful service 
for storing these and from there we'll keep adding on features like messaging/e-mail 
alearts/etc for the users when we get time. Yes, I'm aware that if I open sourced this you 
could help me out with that but I'm sorry, my employer is not on that boat (yet).

For your reference, even just document management is a sticky solution to find in open 
source, we've talked [slashdot.org] about it [slashdot.org] time [slashdot.org] and time 
[slashdot.org] again [slashdot.org].

How To Manage Hundreds of Thousands of Documents?

What is a REST Web Service
The acronym REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this basically means that each 
unique URL is a representation of some object. You can get the contents of that object using 
an HTTP GET, to delete it, you then might use a POST, PUT, or DELETE to modify the object 
(in practice most of the services use a POST for this).

The main advantages of REST web services are:
* Lightweight - not a lot of extra xml markup
* Human Readable Results
* Easy to build - no toolkits required

For consuming web services, its sometimes a toss up between which is easier. For instance 
Google's AdWords web service is really hard to consume (in CF anyways), it uses SOAP 
headers, and a number of other things that make it kind of difficult. On the converse, 
Amazon's REST web service can sometimes be tricky to parse because it can be highly nested, 
and the result schema can vary quite a bit based on what you search for.

Which ever architecture you choose make sure its easy for developers to access it, and well 
documented.

...
It also supports iPod synchronization. I was able to bring tunes in from my iPod and to put 
new songs on the iPod. I could also place my music on a network drive and then use iTunes to

some delay specified for each host. ZUPS can be
configured to ignore these delays and run the specified
commands immediately if the UPS devices are running out
of battery power. Custom plugins can easily be added in
order to perform other checks.

Cool slashdot on Tesseract OCR program
======================================
Google Releases Tesseract as Open Source:
http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/06/09/04/2215210.shtml
"Google recently released Tesseract as open source. Originally
developed at the HP Labs from 1985-1995, it has been touted as one
of the most accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) programs
available. Having sat on the shelf gathering dust for so many years,
Google cleaned up some of the more outdated portions of the code
and released it for general consumption. You can download Tesseract
over at Sourceforge.

Announcing Tesseract OCR
http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/08/announcing-tesseract-ocr.html
We wanted to let you all know that a few months ago we quietly
released - or actually re-released - an Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) engine into open source. You might wonder
why Google is interested in OCR? In a nutshell, we are all
about making information available to users, and when this
information is in a paper document, OCR is the process by
which we can convert the pages of this document into text that

MythBurnInstallation - MythTV
MythBurn is one of several solutions to the problem of getting video
out of your MythTV box on to DVD-Video discs so you can play them in
your DVD player. The user interface for Mythburn integrates into
Mythweb and allows you to select recordings to store on the DVD,
graphics and sound for the DVD menu etc. Mythburn can either create
an ISO-image of the DVD, that you can burn on a different PC or it
can burn the DVD directly, if you have a DVD-writer in the backend.
If a recording is too large to fit on a DVD, Mythburn will
automatically shrink (recompress) the recording, so that the
resulting size is less than 4.7 GB.
